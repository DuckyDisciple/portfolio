![Waypoint Member Site](./images/waypoint_app.jpg)

The [Waypoint Member's Site](https://www.waypoint.info) is an extension of the main [Waypoint Church](https://www.waypointchurch.com) site. It offers additional functionality for those attending the church, such as a form to get connected, links for next steps in your Christian walk, and the ability to take your own notes alongside the sermon notes and have a copy of both mailed to yourself.

The app is a Progressive Web App, so it will prompt you to install the app to your phone the first time you visit. Not only does it allow offline use this way, but it also preloads the data for better usability. All of the data for the site is loaded on the original site for easy updates by the staff at Waypoint Church.
